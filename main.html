			I tell all my couples: “This is your day and I’m here to document everything.” I encourage them to enjoy their wedding day, to be who they are and let me be who I am.
			One of my former grooms, told me after his wedding: “Looking at your photos showed me all the wonderful moments I wouldn’t have remembered.”
